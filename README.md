# Powerlifting: Meet Attempt Selection Calculator
This app was developed by using coach Matt Gary guidance on which percentages where best to attempt at a powerlifting meet. There is no attempt selection calculator on both android and iOS AppStore. So I decided to wrote this as a side project. As for now, you can downloaded it from Google Play Store. Stay Tune for iOS.
